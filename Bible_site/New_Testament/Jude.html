                    &ensp;<sup><small> 1 </small></sup> Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, <br><br/> &emsp;To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: <br/><br/>
                    &ensp;<sup><small> 2 </small></sup> Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. <br><br>

                <h3>The Sin and Doom of Ungodly People</h3>
                <p>
                    &ensp;<sup><small>3</small></sup> Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people.
                    <sup><small>4</small></sup> For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have sevretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord. <br>
                    <sup><small>5</small></sup> Though you already know all this, I want to remind that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.
                    <sup><small>6</small></sup> And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling &mdash; these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgement on the great Day.
                    <sup><small>7</small></sup> In a similar way, Sodom and Gamorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. they serve as an example to those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. <br>
                    &ensp;<sup><small>8</small></sup> In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pullute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.
                    <sup><small>9</small></sup> But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
                    <sup><small>10</small></sup> Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct &mdash; as irrational animals do &mdash; will destroy them. <br>
                    &ensp;<sup><small>11</small></sup> Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; They have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion. <br>
                    <sup><small>12</small></sup>
                    <sup><small>13</small></sup>
                    <sup><small>14</small></sup>
