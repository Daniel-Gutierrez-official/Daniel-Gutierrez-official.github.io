                    <sup><small> 1 </small></sup> Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, <br/> To those who have been called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ: <br/><br/>
                    <sup><small> 2 </small></sup> Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance. <br><br>

                <h3>The Sin and Doom of Ungodly People</h3>
                <p>
                    <sup><small>3</small></sup> Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God's holy people. <br><br>
                    <sup><small>4</small></sup> For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have sevretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord. <br>
                    <sup><small>5</small></sup> Though you already know all this, I want to remind that the Lord at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.
