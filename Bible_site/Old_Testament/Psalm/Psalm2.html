    <p>
        <sup><small> 1 </small></sup> Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
        <sup><small> 2 </small></sup> The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band togethr against the LORD and against his anointed, saying,<br><br>
        <sup><small> 3 </small></sup> "Let us break their chians and throw off their shackles." <br><br>
        <sup><small> 4 </small></sup> The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them.
        <sup><small> 5 </small></sup> He rebuked them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, <br>
        <sup><small> 6 </small></sup> "I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain." <br><br>
        <sup><small> 7 </small></sup> I will proclaim the LORD'S decree: <br><br> He said to me, "You are my son; today I have become your father.
        <sup><small> 8 </small></sup> Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.
        <sup><small> 9 </small></sup> You will break them with a rod of iron; you will dash them to pieces like pottery" <br><br>
        <sup><small> 10 </small></sup> Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth.
        <sup><small> 11 </small></sup> Serve the LORD with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling.
        <sup><small> 12 </small></sup> Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
