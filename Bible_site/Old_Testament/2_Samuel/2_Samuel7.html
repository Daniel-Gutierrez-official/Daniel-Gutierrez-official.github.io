    <big> God's Promise to David </big> <br/>
    <sup><small> 1 </small></sup> After the king was settled in his palace and the LROD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
    <sup><small> 2 </small></sup> he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent."<br><br>
    <sup><small> 3 </small></sup> Nathan replied to the king, "Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the Lord is with you."<br><br>
    <sup><small> 4 </small></sup> But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan saying: <br><br>
    <sup><small> 5 </small></sup> "Go and tell my servant David,'This is what the LORD says; Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
    <sup><small> 6 </small></sup> I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.
    <sup><small> 7 </small></sup> Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I evert say to any of their rulers whome I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?"'<br><br>
    <sup><small> 8 </small></sup> "Now then, tell my servant David,'This is what the LORD Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel.
    <sup><small> 9 </small></sup> I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men on earth.
    <sup><small> 10 </small></sup> And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and non longer be distrurbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
    <sup><small> 11 </small></sup> and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my poeple Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies.'" <br><br> "'The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you:
    <sup><small> 12 </small></sup> When your days are over and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to suceed you, your own flesh and blood, and i will establish his kingdom.
    <sup><small> 13 </small></sup> He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
    <sup><small> 14 </small></sup> I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with a rod wielded by men, with floggings inflicted by human hands.
    <sup><small> 15 </small></sup> But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
    <sup><small> 16 </small></sup> Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever'" <br><br>
    <sup><small> 17 </small></sup> Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation. <br><br>
