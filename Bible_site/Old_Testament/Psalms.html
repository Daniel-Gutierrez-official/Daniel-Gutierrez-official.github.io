                    <sup><small> 33 </small></sup> Teach me, Lord the way of your decrees, that I may follow it to the end.
                    <sup><small> 34 </small></sup> Give me understanding, so that I may keep your law and obey it with all my heart.
                    <sup><small> 35 </small></sup> Direct me in the path of your commands, for there I find delight.
                    <sup><small> 36 </small></sup> Turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain. 
                    <sup><small> 37 </small></sup> Turn my eyes away from worthless things; preserve my life according to your word.
                    <sup><small> 38 </small></sup> Fulfill your promise to your servant, so that you may be feared.
                    <sup><small> 39 </small></sup> Take away the disgrace I dread, for your laws are good.
                    <sup><small> 40 </small></sup> How I long for your precepts! In your righteousness preserve my life.
